# Composer template for Stratos ERP.
Based on the composer template for Drupal projects - https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project
All instructions in that readme - https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project/blob/8.x/README.md
are also valid for this repository, but the create command is different as follows:

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project singularo/stratos-drupal-project:8.x-dev some-dir --no-interaction
```

For any further/more advanced usage instructions, please refer to the readme on the
composer template for Drupal projects - https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project
